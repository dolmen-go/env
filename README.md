# env - The POSIX env utility implemented in Go

See the [IEEE Std 1003.1-2017 specification](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/).

## Synopsis

```
env [-i] [name=value ...] [utility [argument ...]]
```

## Install

You probably don't want to install this program because Unix-like environments already have an implementation, so this is redundant.

However you might want to run the command as a portable tool for both Unix and Windows environments in a Go developer environment:

```console
$ go run github.com/dolmen-go/env@latest -i a=1 b=2
a=1
b=2
```

## Why?

This pure Go implementation of `env` allows to use set environment variables in a portable way for [`//go:generate` commands](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go@latest#hdr-Generate_Go_files_by_processing_source):

```
//go:generate -command env go run github.com/dolmen-go/env@v0.1.0
//go:generate env GOTELEMETRY=off GOPROXY=off go run process.go
```

Or even:

```
//go:generate -command go-run go run github.com/dolmen-go/env@v0.1.0 GOTELEMETRY=off GOPROXY=off go run
//go:generate go-run process.go
